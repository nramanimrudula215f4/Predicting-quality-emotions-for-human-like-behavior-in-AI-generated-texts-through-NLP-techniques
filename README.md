# Predicting-quality-emotions-for-human-like-behavior-in-AI-generated-texts-through-NLP-techniques

The work focuses on improving sentiment analysis and emotion classification for low-resource languages by overcoming 3 major obstacles, such as culture, dataset mistrust, and metric evaluation issues. A framework is put forward which consists of three principal components: a detection model for automated content vs non-automated content, a behavior model for sentiment analysis concerning AI's ability to impersonate human emotions, and an NLP insights component for AI and human text comparison. This method decreases reliance on large language models (LLMs), which in turn enhances accuracy, equity and efficiency in sentiment analysis leading to more dependable, comprehensive, and trustworthy automated systems.

**Conclusion**
The Human-Like NLP Framework is about assessing and improving the AI‚Äôs performance in regard to human simulation while generating text. With the use of high end NLP along with recognition and rating of the expressed sentiment, the framework guarantees that the output text produced by AI is believable in terms of the emotion portrayed and the tone of conversations. It does not just pinpoint AI written text. It however, takes the evaluation one step further by assessing coherence, fluency, and affect. This raises the question of how the systems can be more compliant with the human standards. In addition to generating quality text, there is a focus on addressing quality of text by preventing biases and inconsistencies to maintain reliability and trust. This framework has an ability to transform the interactions between humans and computers as well as the communication between complex NLP technologies and the people.
