# Predicting-quality-emotions-for-human-like-behavior-in-AI-generated-texts-through-NLP-techniques

The work focuses on improving sentiment analysis and emotion classification for low-resource languages by overcoming 3 major obstacles, such as culture, dataset mistrust, and metric evaluation issues. A framework is put forward which consists of three principal components: a detection model for automated content vs non-automated content, a behavior model for sentiment analysis concerning AI's ability to impersonate human emotions, and an NLP insights component for AI and human text comparison. This method decreases reliance on large language models (LLMs), which in turn enhances accuracy, equity and efficiency in sentiment analysis leading to more dependable, comprehensive, and trustworthy automated systems.
